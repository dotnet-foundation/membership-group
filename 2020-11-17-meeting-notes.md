The following are the minutes from the main discussions during meeting. For privacy, I've edited out the emails of attendees. I've edited out general business notes (approval of agenda, minutes, etc) for brevity.

*Call to action:* This meeting was all discussion of ideas, nothing below was formally proposed. We want your ideas and thoughts.

***OPEN DISCUSSION: WHAT BENEFITS WOULD ATTRACT MEMBERS?***

The Membership Committee discussed which benefits would attract members. The Committee also discussed their own membership experiences and why they decided to join the .NET Foundation. The following ideas were discussed during this discussion.

- The Foundation should have different membership levels
- The membership levels could be broken into different classifications such as open source contributors and open source project membership. Each classification would receive different benefits.
- The membership levels could be broken into a level for students, a membership level to foster developers, and a level for leaders who are not developers within the Foundation.
- Limit the amount of free memberships allowed to prevent devaluing the membership. 
- Increase the difficulty level of becoming a member to increase membership value.
- Reward members for their contributions, participation and/or for completing set goals. 
- Limit the ability to vote on decisions for members with a certain level of contributions. 
- Ensure the set goals are aligned with the .NET Foundationâ€™s initiatives. 
- Move forward with the IAMDotNet program to highlight member accomplishments on the public website. 
- Create a mentorship program
- Gamify the membership levels

***OPEN DISCUSSION: WHAT SHOULD BE REQUIREMENTS TO BECOME A MEMBER***

The Membership Committee discussed which requirements should be implemented to become a member. The Committee agreed to revisit membership requirements after the new membership categories and levels are determined. The Committee will work to create a survey to better understand what membership categories and levels are needed.
