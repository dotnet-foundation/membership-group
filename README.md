# The .NET Foundation Membership Committee

The committee is responsible for evaluating new member applications and discussing membership criteria.

## Details

**Chairperson(s):** [Bill Wagner](https://github.com/BillWagner)

**Meets:** 1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month at 1:30pm UTC

**Repository:** https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership

## Governance

The meeting notes are available [here](meetings).

This working group seeks to have a diverse set of representatives from various stakeholders. At the same time, we try to keep the working group somewhat small so that we can have productive meetings. But in order to satisfy the desire for open participation from everyone – and in the sake of transparency – we made this repo public, which includes notes and proposals that documents the progress of the working group. If you have any questions, please open a discussion.
