# Board member responsibilities

The purpose of this document is to outline the responsibilities of board members and committee chairs and estimated time one needs to spend volunteering for the .NET Foundation.

## Summary

The purpose of the board of directors is to drive the strategic direction of the .NET Foundation in order to have a meaningful, positive impact on the .NET open source ecosystem. The board takes into consideration many things including approving budgets pend, driving membership,bringing in sponsorship income, supporting projects, growing our community, education and awareness, and legal issues to support the strategic initiatives. Many of these areas are driven by committees and working groups. The board functions as a leadership team, directing the activities of these committees. In addition, the board has the responsibility to create the foundation’s budget and track progress on income and expenses based on that budget. The board uses these income projections to plan how quickly the foundation can scale its activities.

The .NET Foundation is a young organization. Therefore it has an active board, meaning that each board member is responsible for the success of at least one committee, either by chairing the committee or being an active participant. Each committee has a different set of priorities and number of volunteers helping. Depending on the committee, a board member may need to take a very active role as a committee chair, or may be able to participate in multiple committees that require less time. In either case, the board member’s role is to provide insight into the foundation’s activities as a whole and its current financial health.

## Board responsibilities

The .NET Foundation board functions as the leadership team for the .NET Foundation. The board:

- Sets goals for the foundation
- Sets strategic direction to achieve those goals
- Sets the yearly budget to ensure the financial wellbeing of the foundation
- Manages the foundation’s performance against the yearly budget

In addition to the overall direction of the foundation, individual board members are active in each of the Foundation’s committees. On these committees, the board member may take an active leadership role, or may function as a liaison with other committees and the board as whole. Committee chairs are chosen at the first board meeting following new board members being sworn in. The new board members and current committee chairs work together to determine new and changed assignments.

**Board members are expected to allocate at least 4 hours per week to Foundation tasks.** This encompasses the overall board tasks and all committee related tasks.

## Committee roles and responsibilities

### [Marketing Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing)

The marketing committee is here to help spread the message of openness in the .NET ecosystem. We support community and project initiatives, drive awareness and increase membership. We create consistent, powerful storytelling to increase share of conversation and establish industry relevance for the .NET Foundation.

The marketing committee is composed of volunteers that are primarily marketers, not developers (although there are some more technical than others). They are developer marketing and technical marketers that care about and/or have bet their businesses on .NET. This is a smaller committee because most people that show interest in volunteering are not interested in marketing and are referred to the outreach committee which is focused on community activities and education.

The main goals of the marketing committee are:

- Increase membership
- Generate awareness (of .NET open source and the .NET Foundation itself)
- Foster and grow an open, healthy.NET community

#### Marketing Committee Chair

The marketing committee chair is responsible for directing the committee’s marketing strategy and execution.

**Always-on activities** The chair runs monthly meetings with members and is on point for all announcements and air cover (for dealing with bad PR if needed as it arises). They are responsible for the foundation’s web presence, running all the social handles(Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) and growing followers, pulling together and sending the bi-monthly newsletter(MailChimp), driving leads(for newsletter and membership), running the [SWAG store](https://store.dotnetfoundation.org), writing and sending press releases.

**Other activities** They are also responsible for new project “go-to-market” GTM, co-marketing initiatives, event sponsorships & presence, some event management (i.e. .NET Conf), website design & copy,branding and logos, surveys, presentation decks, and coordination with other committees around messaging and awareness as needed.

***Time commitment: 40-60 hrs./month***

## [Outreach Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-outreach)

The Outreach Committee is here to welcome developers of all backgrounds,education, and technology ecosystems into the .NET ecosystem. We are here to help you organize and evangelize.

## [Membership Committee](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership)
