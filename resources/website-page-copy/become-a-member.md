## Benefits of becoming a member

### Opportunity to influence

Each year, we'll host an election for the board of directors. Each .NET Foundation member can vote in the election, or even choose to run! You can also take part in the various .NET Foundation committees to input on how the .NET Foundation can benefit your passion. [Find out more about the committees here](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/committees)

### Stay up to date

By being where it happens, you get to hear the news first. Even if you decide to take on a more passive member role, you can still access the discussions and information, and stay up to date through reliable sources. The .NET Foundation is an independent organization, and we need you to maintain this independence. By involving people that are passionate about .NET, that have different backgrounds and work for diverse companies, and with independent funding, we can create a powerful organization that furthers sustainable open source, a diverse and open community, and that helps evolve this incredible ecosystem that we are very passionate about.

### Other advantages

There are lots of opportunities to network, find out about great events near you, be the first to hear about changes from projects supported by the .NET Foundation AND MORE!

Depending on your interest in .NET and the activities you participate in there are a wide array of benefits you can get from membership [this page on membership participation types outlines just some of the reasons why you might want to join](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/blob/main/member-participation-types.md).

## What's involved in the application process?

First, we validate the personal information:

* First and Last name are reviewed to eliminate potential 'bots'.

* A valid email address: We only validate that it is a valid email address format. Later, when an invitation is sent, that verifies that it's a real address.

* Optionally, a valid GitHub ID: If you provide a GitHub ID, we validate the profile appears to be human.

In addition, we ask for contribution activity in one or more of the [membership participation types defined](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/blob/main/member-participation-types.md). 

An application need not fill out each section, but may include any relevant contributions in any section. The application will be reviewed in total: breadth across areas and depth in a single area are both considered.
