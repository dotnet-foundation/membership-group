# How to join

* Any individual contributor to a .NET Foundation project can apply to become a member. Contributions may include code contributions, documentation, or other significant project contribution, including evangelism, teaching, code, organizing events, etc. If in doubt, please ask us at contact@dotnetfoundation.org
* Upon approval, members will be notified with information on completing their membership. Individual member dues help support our operations and activities, but are voluntary - you can set your own amount, or opt-out entirely. We don't tie an individual's payment to his or her membership rights and privileges. We don't want dues to be an obstacle for anyone who is interested in getting involved. We request members pay suggested $100 annual dues.
* Each year, we'll host an election for the board of directors. Any active member can campaign for a one year term, based on their community standing, plans to advance the .NET open source ecosystem, and past performance in case they are seeking reelection.
* Each .NET Foundation member can vote in the election.

Just fill out the form below to let us know how you've contributed to one or more .NET Foundation projects. Please be specific - don't just link to a project, link to individual commits, pull requests, or other individual contributions.
