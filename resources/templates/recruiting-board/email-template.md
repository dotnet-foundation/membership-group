Hi _Name_

I'm reaching out as I think you would be a valuable addition to the .NET Foundations Board.

Part of why I think you would be great for this is _add some personal detail helping the candidate recognize why they would be great_

Below is some more detail about what is entailed: 

**Time Commitments**
- 1.5 hours per month to attend regular board meetings. Expect another 1 hour per month to review materials from committees to prepare for the meeting.
- 5 hours per month serving on one of the .NET Foundation committees. Board members are expected to work with one of the committees.
- 6 to 4 hours per month on tasks for committees, or working with foundation members.

**Responsibilities**
- Set goals for the foundation.
- Set strategic direction to achieve those goals.
- Set the yearly budget to ensure the financial wellbeing of the foundation.
- Manages the foundationâ€™s performance against the yearly budget.

If you are interested, I would be happy to help you through the process of the application. Please let me know and we can arrange between us the best way to go forward.

You will first need to be a member of the .NET Foundation, if you aren't already.

Again, I can help guide you through the application process if you have any questions.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
