Hi _Name_

I'm reaching out as I think you would be a great addition to the .NET Foundation nomination committee. The purpose of the committee is to reach out to people you think should apply for the .NET Foundation board, and to refine the applications down to a list of candidates for the .NET Foundation members to then vote on, based on their submissions.

If you might be interested, please let me know and I'll give you more details about what this role involves and how to take part.
