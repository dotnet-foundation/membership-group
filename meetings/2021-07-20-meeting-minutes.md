## Fiscal year 2022

The board is having a special meeting to set goals for the fiscal year from July 2021 - July 2022. Let's discuss what the membership committee views as the goals.

### [#21 - Determine the value proposition for membership](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/21)

The Membership Committee held a discussion on the .NET Foundation’s value proposition. The following ideas were discussed:

- Create “How to” guides for promoting the Foundation’s projects and encourage participation.
- Promote the new member participation types and their benefits on the website.
- Promote current member contributions from the community.
- Encourage more corporate member contributions to the Foundation to offset Microsoft’s contributions.
- Promote ways members can get involved in the community that can be rewarded.
- Teach members how to find a “good” issue or PR.
