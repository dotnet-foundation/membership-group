- Nicole Miller
- Ove Bastiansen
- Jess White
- Nadeem Abutaa
- Tom Pappas

## Board updates

- **Updates from other committees**: Katie Savage and Frank Odoom will co-chair the education committee. They are currently reaching out to existing committee members to get the status of work in progress.

## Membership Portal (VMX)

Tom Pappas gave an update on the new membership portal and briefly talked about financial considerations. He then discussed the need for a membership application and asked for feedback with regard to whether the committee would want a vetting phase for applications. 

The committee then discussed pricing for membership as well as options for changing the pricing model. Instead of the barrier to entry being financial, it would be effort based. For example, must volunteer for a workgroup. The committee then discussed doing away with membership fees altogether, given sponsorship opportunities coming in.

Bill emphasized the need to enforce the Code of Conduct and make that known as new members join the foundation.

What do we want as a vetting process?
- Github contributions (projects, issues, discussions, etc)
- run a meetup
- community action
- other activities from the [member profiles](../member-profiles.md).

## All-committee meeting

Update from Jessica: This is starting with an asynchronous discussion among the committees on each committee's goals and projects. From there we will determine what synchronous meeting is best.

## Open Discussion: Membership Value Proposition

Can we take some of the brainstorming ideas from recent meetings and add them to a backlog board?
- update: Several tasks have been created.

## Actions

- Work with Tom and the Executive Committee to make membership be free while maintaining that vetting be done as members apply for membership.
