## Open Discussion: Membership Portal

Tom Pappas discussed the idea that we can repurpose the membership portal originally implemented for the corporate membership portal for individual members. While the corporate membership and sponsorship programs are being redefined, we can revamp it for individual members.

## Open Discussion: Membership Value Proposition

Bill Wagner opened the floor to committee members to discuss different value propositions for members. What can we prioritize for 2022 and how can we bring together the committees for membership? The committee discussed first outlining the priorities of the foundation for the year and evaluate the charters of committee accordingly as opposed to evaluating the committees first. Ultimately, it may be wise to have an overreaching goal and then have the committees that each have their charges reach that overreaching goal.

## Open Discussion: Goals for 2022

Two goals came up, to increase the reach of .Net and to increase the number of contributions to the .Net open source ecosystem. With regard to .Net, it would be good to try and push for a level of diversity. This is something we can discuss at least, from a foundation point of view.

As a brainstorming exercise, we discussed some possible actions from the membership committee's view. All of these are at the ideas stage

- Could membership work with the project and maintainers committee to link meetup groups and project maintainers? Would members be interested in presentations on member projects? Could that drive contribution or use of projects?
- Could membership work with the corporate sponsors committee to provide value for individual members, meetup groups, and sponsors?

## Open Discussion: Building Trust

The committee discussed that many of the issues that the foundation is still facing and its lack of growth can be traced back to the lack of trust. Part of starting to mitigate that for membership is being more transparent about what committees are doing, driving participation, etc.

## Open Discussion: Budget

Bill Wagner discussed the rearranging of the budget and informed the committee that there may be some funds that are part of the membership committee that are repurposed.

## Actions

- Jess White and Nicole to touch base regarding the newsletter.
- Tom and Bill to develop plan for updated membership portal.
