## Board updates

- The board expressed concerns about removing the annual membership fee. The concerns weren't over funding, or the amount. Rather, that a free membership would make it easier for fake or bot accounts to be created. Discussion followed later in the meeting.
- The board has approved the off-boarding process for projects that wish to leave the foundation. The [Marten](https://martendb.io/) project will be the first project. After that others that have expressed interest will be managed.

## Membership Portal actions

Presentation from Virtual on the portal, questions from committee members. We worked through the current approval process, making some modifications to notify committee members to approve based on contributions. Approved moving forward.

## Nominating committee

Discussion on potential candidates, and potential board candidates.

## Membership fee

We discussed other ways to protect the foundation against bot accounts for members without using a fee. The concerns with a fee (regardless of cost) is that many communities aren't as likely to have a credit card. Also, because we don't store credit card info, a small fee doesn't prevent a person from creating multiple accounts. It just costs more.

We're considering using GitHub profiles and validating contributions as a better metric. While someone could create multiple GitHub accounts and submit contributions under multiple identities, that's far less likely. 

## Actions

- All: Propose members for the nominating committee at our next meeting.
