## Agenda ##

* **Nominating Committee**
  * Bill provided an update on the Nominating Committee's progress. The group agreed to build a spreadsheet to track members who have run in the past, contact those members, and update the spreadsheet to reflect their interest.
    * The spreadsheet will help in the future to track who has served and the term limits for each Board member.
  * The Nominating Committee is close to finalizing the slate and there will likely be 7-9 candidates. Those who have expressed interest in running for the Board will likely hear from the Committee within the next week.
    * Once the list is finalized, the candidates' names will be publicized, and their campaigns will begin.
  * Bill noted that due to a late start and the summer holidays, the Nominating Committee is running a little slow with recruitment. He suggested submitting a PR to update the templates and processes to ensure the process starts earlier moving forward.
* **Membership Portal**
  * Tom and Bill discussed the membership portal and reviewed outstanding items to send to Shaina, the VMX representative. Bill confirmed that membership@dotnetfoundation.org should be used as the main contact point; Tom will discuss with Claire and Nicole to confirm whether the email address is active.
  * Bill noted that he sent the membership roster to Shaina. Tom added that the information he obtained from Open Collective is too raw to use and that he would like to find a way to cross-check both spreadsheets.
  * The membership tier has been deactivated; members will no longer receive renewal notices.

## Next Steps / Action Items ##

* Bill to respond to Shaina regarding the VMX portal / membership email address.
* Bill to submit PR to update the templates and processes for the Nominating Committee.
* Tom to discuss membership email address with Claire, check with Nicole if necessary.

**The meeting adjourned at 3:12PM ET**
