# .NET Membership Committee Meeting

Wednesday, 6 July 2022, 3PM ET

## Meeting Attendees

* Bill Wagner
* Shaina Sullivan
* Nicole Miller
* Joe Guadagno
* Jessica White
* Aneesh Ambikavally
* Tom Pappas
* Madison Hardy, Scribe

## Agenda

* **[Pull Request #63: Committee Templates](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/pull/63)**
  * Bill and Jessica have been updating the language for the DNF templates, specifically templates for recruiting participants for the Nomination Committee and candidates for the Board of Directors.
* **[Pull Request #68: Board Responsibilities](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/pull/68)**
  * Bill and Jessica are also updating the responsibilities for members of the Board to standardize the structure and expectations. Descriptors for the Marketing Cmt and Membership Cmt are most detailed, and Tom has provided resources on the general responsibilities for the Board to the overall organization.
    * Bill: Knowing this is still incomplete, should we merge this and continue to work with other committees to update. We can create a second PR for overall Board responsibilities.
    * Joe: Maybe we should merge and have others add as they get to it.
    * Bill: Yes, rather not hold up progress.
    * ACTION: Bill to merge PR #68
* **Nominating Committee**
  * The kick-off meeting is tentatively scheduled for July 8th.
  * ACTION: Jessica to contact Stacy to complete meeting poll
* **Membership Portal**
  * Shaina Sullivan, the VMX representative, presented an update on the membership portal and the process flow to ensure the committee has current information. As an application is submitted as a lead, VMX will take the information (name, email, GitHub username, contributions) and send it to an approved email for DNF review (membership@dotnetfoundation.org). If approved, the applicant is pushed through as a new member and receives a "Welcome Email."
    * ACTION: Committee to send outline of information to include in Welcome Email.
    * Jessica suggested drafting a short piece on what it means to be involved as part of a committee, why she engages, and what has been accomplished over the last few years. Bill agreed and added that Jeremy Sinclair of the Projects Committee could do something similar.
    * Shaina added that she could send samples of different welcome letters - one that includes general information on DNF, and another that includes information on how to get involved and testimonials.
  * VMX can auto-enroll the new member into designated GitHub repositories. Bill noted that while specific repos could later be assigned, it would be beneficial to enroll everyone in the parent team within GitHub. Ultimately, DNF would like to leverage this platform to get people more involved in efforts that align with stated goals.
    * Shaina recommended establishing touch-points after someone joins at three months, and again at six months to check in.
    * Bill stated that this responsibility would likely fall to the Membership Committee. Tom suggested that depending on the new member, the Maintainers could also assist, though it was noted that if a new member is not actively involved within DNF, someone from Membership would be the better point of contact.
    * Shaina asked if it would be beneficial to include a question on the membership application that asks which committee the applicant would like to join.
      * Yes; when someone applies, they include contributions from 1+ membership profiles and that can instruct the Foundation as to where the new member can be most involved.
  * The membership portal can generate and distribute monthly reports that can show broad information (new members, lost members), but can also show member participation in committees. Shaina asked if there was a way to track new members and when they joined through GitHub.
    * As an admin of the DNF GitHub, Bill has access to see some of this information, but it is likely out of date. Moving forward, it would be preferable to receive this report from VMX.
    * In order for the membership report to be accurate, the chairs of each committee would send a roster of the members monthly. This usually occurs in the first two weeks of each month.
  * When members indicate they want to leave the Foundation, VMX can send questions as a retention measure to better understand member concerns. Shaina recommended that someone established within DNF should also reach out as it is a more meaningful gesture.
  * Aneesh noted several points from his personal onboarding experience that could be improved for new members:
    * Clearly establish next steps - what to do, which committees to join, where to get information, etc; Auto-subscribe members to the newsletter.
  * Consider adjusting titles based on engagement: someone subscribed to DNF would be a member; someone active within committees could be a "Fellow."
    * Establish touch-points or create a system to reach out to people who aren't engaged and address any concerns.
    * Re-engage with members who are absent and keep track of attendee lists to best encourage involvement in meetings.
  * Bill expressed a concern about the multiple avenues of communication. Touch-points are important, but there is a divide within the community between which platforms are used for communication (email, newsletter, GitHub, Discord, Slack, etc.). With so many channels, it become inefficient to reach out to everyone, and members become siloed within their preferred platform. He asked Shaina if the VMX portal could consolidate those channels and become a place where everyone can get information and stay involved.
    * Jessica added that a common issue is moderation. There is a [Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct), but it is not always clear where to draw the line and who holds a member accountable when the code is broken.
    * Shaina: Communication is always the biggest problem. Some clients hire a full-time moderator to be the manager and connection between all the platforms. Other clients shrink the tools available so there are less options to utilize.
    * Bill: The Microsoft .NET Product Teams have a good model. There's an internal group of 15 members that discuss any issues and 4 of those members moderate and hold everyone accountable. It's diverse in its makeup and has enough people to work yet is small enough so it's not time-consuming. Unfortunately, the worst offenses occur on Twitter, and that isn't a DNF platform. On GitHub or the portal, it is easier to enforce the code.
    * Tom: VMX is establishing a Community Function. When that goes live, DNF can revisit it as an option to narrow the scope for discussion platforms.
  * The Community Function is similar to GitHub in that there are "All Member" pages and individual groups for people to join. When a new member joins a group, the chair is notified (if approval is needed, the chair is notified and can approve/deny).
    * Bill noted that when onboarding current members, there should be an option to allow people to include PII on their profile. Shaina responded that no information about the members is made public without their knowledge.
    * Shaina said that in order to create the community page, VMX will need a CSV file with the current DNF member roster that includes any information DNF wants to store in the database. Bill advised that DNF would store the name, email, and GitHub handle of each member and allow individuals to add more information if they want.
  * The team discussed how to find a report that would indicate when each member joined DNF. Immediate investigation into GitHub did not prove helpful, and Tom asked if that statistic was tracked in Open Collective. Tom also suggested looking through the payment record log to find the first payment for membership dues.
    * ACTION: Bill and Tom to review Open Collective data to find user join dates.
    * ACTION: Tom to review payment records and export a spreadsheet for membership dues.
    * Aneesh added reference photos and [links](https://api.github.com/users/<USERNAME>/repos) in the chat showing committee join dates in GitHub.
    * Shaina said that VMX can migrate the DNF membership without specific join dates (though exact dates will make membership reports more precise). 
  * Next Steps: Shaina to distribute the below within the next two weeks to membership@dotnetfoundation.org and board@dotnetfoundation.org
    * Sample welcome emails
    * Email template for retention
    * Email template for touch points and a proposed timeline for each touch point
    * Online Application draft
    * Final draft of full migration process
  * Sample membership report
