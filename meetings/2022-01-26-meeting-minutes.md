## All-committee meeting

Jessica will reach out to committee chairs to plan actions and a forum (online meeting or asynchronously) for the chairs and other members to work together better.

## Open Discussion: Membership Value Proposition

The committee discussed different ways that the foundation may increase the visibility of projects and increase engagement between members and project maintainers. Perhaps we could have a sort of pull request for members to contribute to different projects. Bill Wagner briefly discussed the idea of the foundation bringing back the TSG in a new form and having that as an advantage of some sponsors. The committee also discussed a mentor/mentee program; this could be the driving force for the Education Committee in terms of running it. This could be a joint venture considering it is a value proposition for members. The Committee also discussed sending a starter pack to each members; this would be in the form of a guide, how to present your project, how to discuss, etc. Tom Pappas added that resume writing, job boards, etc. could be beneficial to our members.
