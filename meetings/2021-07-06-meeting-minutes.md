## Nominating committee update

I'll share any updates from the board nominating committee.

## Budget discussion

The Membership Committee discussed their budget wish list. The Committee agreed to ask for a budget of $15,000. The following wish list items were discussed:

- Define tooling to build a community.
- Create career development opportunities.
- Better member benefits awareness
- Promoting diversity within the organization
- Sponsor members to attend conferences and code camps. 
- Offer a childcare credit to members who attend certain events.

I proposed more, because the committee is also responsible for a few more expenses:

- The VForce managment system (Which can handle some of the items above)
- The .NET Foundation Meetup Pro subscription.

### [#21 - Determine the value proposition for membership](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/21)

The Membership Committee held a discussion on the .NET Foundation’s value proposition. The following ideas were discussed:

- Create “How to” guides for promoting the Foundation’s projects and encourage participation.
- Promote the new member participation types and their benefits on the website.
- Promote current member contributions from the community.
- Encourage more corporate member contributions to the Foundation to offset Microsoft’s contributions.
- Promote ways members can get involved in the community that can be rewarded.
- Teach members how to find a “good” issue or PR.
