## Updates on previous meetings actions

N/A

---

### Jess has returned and almost recovered from COVID
(yes... after 4 years it got me).

### Membership form
- Aneesh demoed the site he has set up.
- Next actions are to help him get it deployed in the DNF Azure subscription and hosted on website (either sitefinity iframe embed or URL redirect). It would be preferable to set up an deployment pipeline in something like GitHub Actions. 
- @nicoleabuhakmeh need yours and the boards help to identify who can assist Aneesh with this final set up

### Membership submssions done through issues
- Both to be accepted. Will add to the issues directly

### Nominating Committee

- Need to start timelines as last time was a struggle around summer holidays
- Membership committee happy to do the initial organisation again
- Need to get a past board member or someone stepping down to take part as part of the nomination committee for transfer of whats needed on the board.
- Asked to look into "reapplication" as Joe and I are at the end of our current term.

### DNF Champions

- Will have it's own application form
- Can use same processes as membership application to start with
- We'd love to get this running in the next 6 months

### Notes and Actions

- Nicole and Jess need to arrange a time to catch up and get some of this moving before the next membership committee. Would like Aneesh's form up and useable sooner rather than later.
- Jess to find out how to aide Aneesh in getting the new form deployed and published on the .NET Foundation Azure Accounts and Website
