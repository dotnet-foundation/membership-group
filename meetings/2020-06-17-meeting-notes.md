Sorry for posting a few days late, things have en very hectic!   

I will be posting meeting notes here after meetings and significant discussions.  

From last Wednesday, June 17th:  

The nominating committee wants to be transparent about their process and discussions, and therefore we will be posting updates from our meetings. 

The nominating committee has had a first introductory meeting and discussed what is going to happen the next few weeks. All the committee members attended.

In short, the following was discussed:  

The Director Candidate Expectations in the Election Policy do not align with the nomination form questions and might deter candidates from applying. Additionally, the criteria might result in a non-diverse board that is not representative of the .NET community. The committee suggests changing the wording to reflect the expectations. This is not to suggest that there are no requirements, but rather that a candidate can be strong contributor in different areas, be that OSS, organizational, community, etc.  

A second concern was raised, and that was that a candidate must be a member which comes with a fee that is currently set at 100USD. Two problems were pointed out. Electronic payment might not be possible for all candidates , and the fee is a set amount and doesnâ€™t take into account the currency of the candidates country or BNP etc. Although an applicant can request to have the fee waived, the website states it is for those that are students or experience financial hardship, which might not apply to candidates that cannot pay for other reasons. The ongoing pandemic and the economic consequences add to this.  

The concerns will be discussed in the next DNF meeting, and updates/result will be posted here.
Diversity was discussed further, and the members agreed that they want to actively encourage diversity while maintaining **the same criteria and expectations.**

The committee also discussed how to reach out to people (personally), tools that can be used to anonymously rank candidates on a set of common criteria, and if a committee member can opt to not rank on a criteria if information is missing (yes).  

A second meeting has been scheduled for next week and until then the members will actively reach out to people, while keeping an eye on the number of responses from the nomination form. Once the nomination period (ends on 26th of June) is over the committee will go through the candidates individually, before having a meeting to discuss the result.
