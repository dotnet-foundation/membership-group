## Review and comment on Issues

### [#20 - Setting up nomination committee for elections](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/20)

We have interested from most of the returning committee members. We've gotten a good response from the RD and MVP community as well. We'll work to finalize offline and begin the nomination process soon.

### [#21 - Determine the value proposition for membership](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/21)

We focused on three different areas:

- **Benefits from sponsors**: We've been trying to determine how to structure a program that benefits members, sponsors, and the foundation. We think we've found a way to structure a program that does benefit all participants. Members earn awards through participation in the foundation. Those awards are provided by sponsors. We need to formalize this in our next meetings, along with the marketing and corporate member committees. Our thinking is that different participant profiles would earn awards in different ways. It could be contributing to a .NET Foundation project, creating learning materials, running meetups, or any of the activities outlined in the [participant profiles](../member-profiles.md). We'd structure the program so that more participation activities leads to more benefits. We have more work to do, but we like the concept.
- **Career development**: We are pursuing the idea of a mentorship program. Here again, there is more work to structure the program, but we think it would benefit membership overall.
- **Networking**: The year of pandemic isolation is taking its toll on many. We're exploring some form of in person event, when it is safe to do so.
