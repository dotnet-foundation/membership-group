## Introduction

Bill Wagner, the Membership Committee Chair, gave a quick introduction and spoke about the Membership Committee charter
  
**Open Discussion:** Feedback/Questions About Membership Committee Strategy Going Forward

Bill Wagner opened for questions and comments about strategic direction of the Membership Committee going forward. Committee members agreed that we can take steps to set clear lines/boundaries on what falls under the Membership Committee charter.

**Open Discussion**: Corporate Memberships

Bill Wagner discussed and clarified the previous push towards corporate membership in a sense that, the previous board felt they provided the opportunity for the foundation to grow. This would ultimately lead to better project maintenance and support, permanent staffing, etc. The board will reevaluate that going forward.

**Open Discussion**: Forum for .Net Foundation Members to Ask Questions, Get Help, Provide Feedback

Bill Wagner and the committee members in attendance discussed which forum to use when asking .Net members for feedback or even where members can go for help. Ultimately, members need somewhere that they will feel like they are supported. We need to hold ourselves accountable, follow through with action items, follow through on charter, etc. That will increase member trust, engagement, and growth.

Historically, GitHub issues have not ben addressed as quickly as they should be. However, the recent discussions seem to indicate that GitHub should be the center of open conversations in the future.
  
**Open Discussion**: Committee Liaisons

Committee members discussed the prospect of having “Liaisons” from other committees, citing that the efficient dissemination of information was essential to following through on action items and making sure everyone was on the same page. The idea evolved into a monthly meeting of all committees/all committee liaisons.

We reaffirmed that the committee's project board was useful, and we rededicate ourselves to using it. We'll suggest it to other committees as a good practice.

## Action Items

- *Bill Wagner* to discuss keeping committees apprise on board meetings at next board meeting. For example, what would you like to bring up to the board, here is what you missed at the board meeting, etc.
- *Bill Wagner*: Propose to the board quarterly "All-committee meetings" to brainstorm initiatives that span multiple committees.
- *To all committee chairs*: Document the charter of each committee on the website. Point to where ongoing committee updates are published (typically a GitHub repo).
