# Meeting minutes: Tuesday April 20, 2021

## Review action items

- [X] Bill Wagner to reach out to Beth Massi for the RD & MVP Communities email list for the Nominating Committee.
- [X] Tom Pappas to send the Membership Committee suggested language to use for candidates who were not chosen.

## Review and comment on Issues

### [#20 - Setting up nomination committee for elections](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/20)

Previous committee members have been contacted.

### [#21 - Determine the value proposition for membership](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-membership/issues/21)

Discussion on benefits from corporate members in the foundation. What benefits would members enjoy that would also benefit the corporate members? We don't have an answer yet, but we'll continue to discuss.

Proposed other program ideas that could benefit members:

- Sponsor training or conference attendance.
- Mentoring from other foundation members.
- Promote an "ask the experts" around different projects or areas of the .NET ecosystem.

Should these different benefits be tied to different [membership participation types](../member-profiles.md)?

## Board election timeline and nomination committee

We set a goal for having the nomination committee set by the next meeting.
