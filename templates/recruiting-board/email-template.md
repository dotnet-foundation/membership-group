Hi _Name_

I'm reaching out as I think you would be a valuable addition to the .NET Foundations Board.

Part of why I think you would be great for this is _add some personal detail helping the candidate recognize why they would be great_

Below is some more detail about what is entailed: 

**Time Commitments**
- 

**Responsibilities**
- 

If you are interested, I would be happy to help you through the process of the application. Please let me know and we can arrange between us the best way to go forward.

You will first need to be a member of the .NET Foundation, if you aren't already.

Again, I can help guide you through the application process if you have any questions.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
