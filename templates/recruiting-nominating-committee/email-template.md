Hi _Name_

I'm reaching out as I think you would be a great addition to the .NET Foundation nomination committee. The purpose of the committee is to reach out to people you think should apply for the .NET Foundation board, and to refine the applications down to a list of candidates for the .NET Foundation members to then vote on, based on their submissions.

Below is some more detail about what is entailed: 

**Time Commitments**
- Meet every other week to discuss outreach progress and a number of submissions.
- Once all the submissions are in, 2 - 3 hours to go through and rate the submissions based on the given criteria.
- The time for outreach is flexible depending on what the individual has the capacity to do.

**Responsibilities**
- Outreach to others to ask them to consider submitting for a board position and answer any queries about the role of a board member and their commitments.
- Assess diversity split (on all aspects of diversity) and propose what needs doing to encourage a diverse range of submissions for board members.
Share on your networks the opportunity to submit to be a part of the board or become a member of the .NET Foundation.
- Attend meetings.
- Rate submissions based on given criteria.
- Agree on which applications will go through to the final voting stage of the process.
- Help with the copy for communications around how the process was conducted when there are queries after the elections.

**If you are part of the nomination committee you cannot apply for the .NET Foundation Board.** If you are planning to apply for the board, I would be happy to help you with your application and support you in any way I can.

Please let me know if you are interested or not. Looking forward to hearing from you.
