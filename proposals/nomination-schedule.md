## Lessons from last time

- We need a clear and universal message for what are the requirements for becoming a board member. 
  - They need to be a .NET Foundation member.
  - They need to identify with one or more of the member participation types (don't have to be OSS contributors).
  - How this aligns to the purpose of the .NET Foundation (that the .NET Foundation is not purely for OSS).
- Promotion and outreach with diverse groups could be beneficial. We struggled with representation last year.
- Clarity on what is involved in being a board member may help those who aren't sure about going forward for it.
- A list of members for the nomination committee will help them know who they can reach out to and offer support with their applications.
- Are there alternate channels we can promote through beyond the .NET Foundation media channels? Such as asking members who run events to promote the board nomination process.
- When reaching out to potential members of the nominating committee, be sure to explain that nominating committee members can't stand for election.
- We need to reach out underrepresented geographies and groups for the nominating committee to encourage members of those groups and geographies to run for board seats.
